# Project Learning Log

A simple, text-based log to track my coding journey, document what I learn, and practice my Git & GitHub workflow.

## 📖 What is this?

This repository is essentially a digital garden for my brain. It serves two main purposes:
1.  **To Act as a Log:** To consistently record mini-projects, tutorials, and key concepts I'm learning.
2.  **To Practice Git:** This repo is a sandbox for me to practice advanced Git features like branching, pull requests, and conflict resolution.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
project-log/
├── logs/ # Directory containing all my individual log files
│ └── YYYY-MM-DD-learning-log.md
├── README.md # This file - the project homepage
└── .gitignore # Files to ignore in version control


## 📝 How I Use It

1.  Each day I work on something new, I create a new Markdown file in the `logs/` directory (e.g., `logs/2024-10-27-git-practice.md`).
2.  In that file, I write brief notes about what I did, what I learned, and any challenges I faced.
3.  I use a new Git branch for each new log entry or significant change to practice the **Feature Branch Workflow**.
4.  I commit my changes with clear, descriptive messages.
5.  I push my branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request to merge it into the main branch.

## 🛠️ Built With

*   **Markdown**: For all the note-taking.
*   **Git**: For version control.
*   **GitHub**: For remote hosting and practicing collaboration.
